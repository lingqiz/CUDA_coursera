# Course Assignment: Heteregeneous Parallel Programming (From Coursera) 
Link to the course: https://www.coursetalk.com/providers/coursera/courses/heterogeneous-parallel-programming  
Seems this course is no longer active... But it's a great intro to CUDA and parallel programming.   

Common Data Parallelism Paradigm:  
  - vector addition (simples)  
  - convolution  
  - (tiled) matrix multiplication  
  - reduction  
  - parallel scan, prefix sum   
  - application to image processing   
  
Performance consideration:
  - reduce global memory traffic (locality of memory access)  
  - make use of shared memory
  - warps and thread execution   
  - atomic operations
